\begin{rSubsection}{Prezi}{October 2014 - March 2015}{Software Engineer in Infrastructure, Internal Tools}{Budapest, Hungary}
\item Built a front end UI in AngularJS for Prezi's monitoring and alerting system. Wrote unit and integration tests with Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor. Automated development tasks with Grunt.
% \item Extended Prezi's monitoring API (written in Haskell) with a tagging feature for alerting configurations. Originally, alerting items could be searched only by name substring matching. The new feature allows developers to tag their items with an identifier, which in turn allows groupings of several related alerting items displayed in a single page view for easy analysis.
